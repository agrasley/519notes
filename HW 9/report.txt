1. Time and space—O(n + e), where n is the number of nodes and e is the number of edges
2. Time and space—O(n + e), where n is the number of nodes and e is the number of edges
3. Time—O((n + e)log n), Space—O(n + e) where n is the number of nodes and e is the number of edges

5. I like implementing the algorithms in the HW. It really helps me to understand them better.
6. I need more practice with space complexities.
