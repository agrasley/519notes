# sums

## k numbers in array that sum to C

1. sort using quicksort (O(n log n))
2. two pointers starting at ends of array
3. if rightmost + leftmost > C move rightmost to left
4. if rightmost + leftmost == C move both (**only if no duplicates**)
5. if rightmost + leftmost < C move leftmost to right
6. runs in O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n)

## k numbers in array that sum to C in array

1. sort first O(n log n)
2. n x (two pointers) O(n**2)
3. always skip elt currently selected as C when running two pointers
