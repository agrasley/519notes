# Priority Queues

Queues--FIFO, LILO (lines, milk at the supermarket)

Stacks--FILO, LIFO (stack of papers, recursive function calls)

Priority queues--emergency rooms, class registration, etc.

Dijkstra algorithm (shortest path in graph) uses priority queues

Often implemented in a binary heap

## Binary heap

* node is smallest
* tree should be balanced
  * Only lower right corner of triangle should be empty
  * can be implemented as an array
    * can traverse in level order (BFS)
    * for a node i, its parent is (i-1)//2
    * for a node i, its left child is 2i + 1
    * for a node i, its right child is 2i + 2
* insertion of > goes to last position in array
* insertion of < requires swapping of leaves and roots
* heap insertion is bubble up (O(log n))
* deletion
  * always delete root in priority queue
  * one way is bubble down
  * other way is to swap last element into root's place, then bubble down
  * O(log n)
* heapsort (O(n log n))
  * like insertion sort using balanced BSTs which also runs in O(n log n)
  * n * insertion + n * deletion = n log n
  * heapify + n * deletion = n log n (slightly faster)
* bubble down most of the work is cheap because last row does no work, 2nd to last row does log(1) work, etc.
