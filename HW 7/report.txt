  a. Time—O(k log k + n log (n+k)); Space—O(n+k)
  b.
    i.  To create the initial heap use heapify. Time—O(k + n log (n+k)); Space—O(n+k)
    ii. k - n candidates will be ignored/unused. Use quickselect to find n smallest
    pairs, then ignore all other pairs. Time—O(k + n log n); Space—O(n)
2.  Space: O(X) Time: O(nX)
