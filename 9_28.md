# k-closest values

## unsorted

if you sort the array, it runs in O(n log n), which is too long

create a new array of the distances from every element to n, then find k smallest elements

then run quickselect with k

then find all elements <= the result of quickselect

then select first k elements from the resulting list and return them

O(n) complexity (5 passes and each is O(n))

## sorted

use two pointers on two closest values, select the closest and move its pointer further away from n

# insertion sort

iterate through list and insert where it should be O(n**2)
