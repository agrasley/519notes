## Num Inversions

How many pairs are in the wrong order in a list? (e.g. [2, 4, 1, 3] has 3 inversions)

Naive algorithm of nested for-loops runs in O(n**2)

Byproduct of mergesort (divide and conquer + two pointers)

  * Whenever you merge, keep a tally of the numbers larger than the merged number

Runs in O(n log n)

## Longest Path in Binary Tree

Only three possibilities:

* Deepest on left, deepest on right, deepest through root

At every node, what is the longest path within your subtree? What is your depth?
  - report to your parent
  - only one recursive function

Runs in O(n) because you only visit each node once
