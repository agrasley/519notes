## Quick select

runs in O(log n)

worst case O(n**2)

gets k^th smallest element

if k is <= pivot, recursively search left

if k == p + 1 return pivot

if k > p + 1, search right

### with randomized pivot

runs in O(n) (expected)

## Merge sort

runs in O(n log n) (deterministic (no worst case)) (stable--quicksort with randomized pivot is unstable)

many algorithms have divide (split), conquer (recursively apply), and merge (recombine)

merge sort:
* divide: split in half O(1) (trivial) (vs. O(n) partition in quicksort)
* merge: O(n) (vs. O(1) trivial in quicksort)

two pointers problems--compare two, advance one
